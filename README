Sish is a simple shell.

Files:
	sish.cpp

To compile sish:
	make

To delete compiled files:
	make clean

To run:
	cd to the directory sish is in.
	./sish
	At the prompt, type commands.
	sish > (command goes here)

To run by passing a file:
	cd to the directory sish is in.
	Place the file you want to run in the same directory (optional, but recommended)
	./sish < filename
	OR
	./sish < ./filename

Known Limitations:
	- When invoking sish and passing a file (for example: "sish < testfile"), 
		there MUST be an extra blank line below the last command, or the final command will not be executed.
		This is less a limitation of our program and more a limitation of cin.
